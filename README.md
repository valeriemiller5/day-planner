# day-planner

## About this App
> Simple day planner to record activities and To Do's throughout the day in scheduled hourly blocks.  Using Moment.js, the current day of the week and date appear at the top of the screen.  Schedule blocks are highlighted compared to the current time (past blocks are gray, current is yellow, future blocks are green).  Build with jQuery, Moment.js, Google Fonts, Sweetalerts2, Ionicons, with styling using Bulma CDN and CSS stylesheet.

## Background
> As a tutor and TA for a coding bootcamp, I'm frequently asked questions on homework assignments.  While I could just look at the provided solutions, I prefer to create a solution "in my own writing".  This way, I can better help my students find their own problem solving solutions by explaining to them how I would go about the assignment.
